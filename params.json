{"name":"Nodev","tagline":"Wrapper for nodemon and node-inspector as a new version nodev","body":"# Description\r\n\r\nNodev is a wrapper for `nodemon` and `node-inspector`. It will automatically start Node.js process in debug mode and start node-inspector attached to it.\r\n\r\n# Installation\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ sudo npm install -g nodev\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Usage\r\n\r\nStart with default settings:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ nodev ./app.js\r\n```\r\nThis will start your script as Node.js application with `--debug=7000` option. To start application paused at first line use:\r\n```sh\r\n$ nodev --debug-brk ./app.js\r\n```\r\nThis will start your application as if it was executed with `--debug-brk=7000` option.\r\n\r\n# What doesn't work\r\nCurrently there is no way to specify another debugging port apart of `7000`. If you try to debug two applications at the same time it will show error that port is in use. To change this behavior either submit ticket and then I will do it when I have time or send me a pull request.\r\n","google":"UA-48986350-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
